# Ballastwater_EnvirModel_CommPP_IndivPP_ColoP
Mechanistic models created in R to model the invasion risk of zooplankton with varying levels of community propagule pressure, individual propagule pressure, and colonization pressure.

Files include:
Model_CommPropPressure.R - Mechanistic model which held community propagule pressure and colonization pressure constant and varied individual propagule pressure
Model_IndivPropPressure.R - Mechanistic model which held individual propagule pressure constant for each community propagule pressure and colonization pressure constant
discharge_volumes.csv - Raw data discharge volumes used in simulations
